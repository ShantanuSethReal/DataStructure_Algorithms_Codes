    JTextField(String text)	Creates a new TextField initialized with the specified text
    The setLayout(...) method allows you to set the layout of the container, often a JPanel, to say FlowLayout, BorderLayout, GridLayout, null layout, or whatever layout desired
     The setEditable() method has one Boolean parameter. If the parameter is false, then the user cannot type into the field. 
     The addActionListener method takes the current class object as a parameter. The "this" key word simply means "this object I'm working in right now". If you are using netbeans, you can type "this" and put a period after it to see all the methods defined in "this" class. It should list all the methods that are defined in your class including any inherited methods.
